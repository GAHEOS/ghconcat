"""
Path resolver utilities.

This module consolidates the default path resolver to the workspace-aware
implementation while preserving public API compatibility:

- `DefaultPathResolver` is now an alias of `WorkspaceAwarePathResolver`.
- Base `PathResolver` also tracks a workspace root so that all concrete
  resolvers behave consistently.
- `PathResolverProtocol` is re-exported here to preserve the import path
  used in ghconcat.__init__.

Design goals:
- Keep the API stable for external imports.
- Enforce workspace-aware safety where requested by the engine.
