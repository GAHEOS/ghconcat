| `__manifest__.py`                            | Low      | The author field is specified as "Your Company", which is a placeholder and may not be appropriate for a production environment.                              | Replace "Your Company" with the actual name of the author or organization responsible for the module.                                                                   |
| `vet_owner.py`                               | Low      | The email field does not validate email format.                                                                                                               | Use `fields.Char(string="Email", required=True, help="Contact email")` to add a help tooltip, and later use Odoo's `tools.email_validate` to validate email format.    |
| `vet_pet.py`                                 | Low      | There is no constraint or default defined for the 'species' field.                                                                                            | Consider adding a default value or constraint for 'species' if applicable.                                                                                             |
| `vet_visit.py`                               | High     | The `now` variable might not account for timezone differences when used inside `_check_visit_date`.                                                           | Use `self.env.user.tz` to adjust `now` to the user's timezone to prevent future dates incorrectly passing the constraint.                                               |
| `vet_security.xml`                           | Medium   | The module doesn't define any record rules, which might lead to unexpected access to data.                                                                    | Implement record rules to finely control access to records based on user roles and other business conditions.                                                          |
| `ir.model.access.csv`                        | Medium   | The access rights for all users and managers are overly permissive, particularly write and unlink rights for all model fields.                                | Revise the access rights, restricting where necessary especially for non-managerial roles, and limit deletion rights (unlink) to manager and above roles where proper. |

### Overall Verdict: ‚ùå

The module contains potential issues primarily related to security and access control, which need to be addressed before the module can be considered production-ready. Additionally, minor improvements can be made for better user experience and data integrity.
