| Linear-optical gates | Deterministic CNOT remains >90 dB loss-budget dream; hybrid measurement-based approaches most promising. | Can η_det ≥ 95 % SNSPDs plus temporal multiplexing close the gap? |
| Integrated sources   | On-chip χ² micro-rings achieve 300 MHz pair rate at p-pump = 40 mW.                                      | Thermal cross-talk scaling beyond 100 sources?                    |
| Error models         | Dephasing now dominates over loss in tightly confined waveguides.                                        | Need unified benchmarking across foundries.                       |
| Applications         | Near-term advantage in photonic machine-learning inference.                                              | Energy/latency trade-off vs silicon AI accelerators.              |

### Author’s critique

The review glosses over cryo-packaging challenges and the *actual* cost of ultra-low-loss SiN (≤0.5 dB m⁻¹). Include
comparative LCA data in future work.
